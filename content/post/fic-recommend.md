I launched this today as it’s become fairly polished under my own
personal use.

The ranking algorithm is pretty simple but actually works fairly well.

Here’s how it works:

1\. Gets a story in the form of a URL

2\. Look up all the users who have liked/favorited that story.

3\. Count all the favorited stories of those users.

4\. Display the top 50 stories by number of favorites.
