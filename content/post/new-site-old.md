Iâ€™ve done a complete rewrite of the site using Polymer. It was pretty
quick to write and has some neat features such as this embedded blog
backed by tumblr. You can see the old blog at <http://blog.fn.lc> .

It also does live fetches of my most popular GitHub projects.

Both of these are implemented by directly accessing the respective APIs
using iron-ajax.
