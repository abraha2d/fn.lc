I just added easy custom CSS on WebSync documents. It might not be for the best&hellip; However, it works quite well and like everything you can edit the css in one window and preview the changes on the other. :D

A future update might add some sort of local CSS so you can only
customize things under the .content\_well div. Right now you can style
anything on the page.
